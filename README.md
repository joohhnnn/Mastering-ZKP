Understanding the Principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) through Practical Life Scenarios

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) might sound mysterious, but it's not an unreachable knowledge in the field of cryptography. In this summary, I'll attempt to explain the basic concepts, workings, and applications of ZKP in the simplest everyday language. You don't need to have any professional cryptographic background. As long as you're interested in this topic, you can understand and learn how to use ZKP in daily life and work. Let's step into the world of cryptography with ease together!
